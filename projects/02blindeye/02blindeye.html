<h5>The Deep Image of the City</h5>
<br />
<p>
  DeepScope is a novel platform for interactive, real-time, and setup-less urban design visualization. It attempts to substitute common practices of urban design with a machine-learnt, generative visualization approach. By implementing a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) and CityScope, a tangible user interface, this project  allows for real-time prototyping and visualizations of urban design processes.   <br>

  <div id="demo" class="collapse">Visual representation in architecture, urban design, and planning is critical for both the design and decision-making processes. Despite major advancements in the field of computer graphics, crafting visual representations is still a complex and costly task, usually carried out by highly trained professionals. This is particularly true during preliminary design stages—such as zoning exercises or schematic design—in which key decisions are made, yet partial information about final design details is available. This work attempts to substitute common practices of urban design visualization with a machine-learnt, generative approach. By implementing a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) and a tangible user interface (TUI), this work aims to allow for real-time urban prototyping and visualizations.</div>
